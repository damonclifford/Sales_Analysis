# Sales_Analysis
We try to derive some Business Insights.

This is a classic eaxmple of some basic business analysis Questions.

We have monthly sales data from an online retailer. 
We analyze this data to answer 4 key questions we usually come across such analysis:

Q1. What was the Best month for sale?<br>
Q2. Which City had the most sales?<br>
Q3. What would be a good time to display advertisement to maximise purchases?<br>
Q4. What products are most often sold together?<br>


NOTE: As usual with python there is always more than one way to do something, Here you may come across a few methods that you may feel as slow,
but it is a demonstration of sheer flexibility that python offers to process our data.
Also, There are multiple ways to answer the same question, whith many of them being better than mine, but then again the path to perfection is a never ending one
and this is just an demonstration. ;)

Cheers!
